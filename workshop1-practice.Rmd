# Let's keep it rolling!

What I will learn at the end of the tutorial:

- How to install R and RStudio - all ready to go and do awesome things in R! 

- How to navigate in RStudio and not lose your way

- How to use projects

- How to create and use different file formats: R script vs RMarkdown

- How to find, load and use libraries.

- How to assign variables

- How to use inbuilt datasets

- How to load data files

- How to create a basic RMarkdown file

- How to generate summary stats for the dataset

- How to generate simple data viz

### Resources:
R for data science, Hadley Wickham https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

### Install R and RStudio 

Start installation with 

1. R from https://cran.rstudio.com/ 

2. RStudio https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 

If you do NOT want to install R/Rstudio, you can use a cloud version - 

but you need to create an account there.

### Projects in R

**Project**: all files associated with a particular research project (e.g. data files, R scripts, results, figures)

Click File > New Project

### R script vs RMarkdown files

R script: "pure" R code - great for data analysis, not so great for sharing with non-R people

RMarkdown: a file that integrates your narration with the R code. Great for sharing with non-R people!

*Hint*: use R script to prepare your analysis and RMarkdown to communicate it - copy and paste your R code there!

### How to find, load and use libraries.

CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/

Task Views at CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/

"Digging" into packages

**Task** Using task view find 2 packages that you are interested in exploring for your research.


- installing vs loading packages

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Data analysis workflow

![rscript](img/data-science-explore.png)

### Coding basics

Use R as a calculator:

```{r}
1 / 200 * 30
(59 + 73 + 2) / 3
sin(pi / 2)
```

Create new objects with `<-:`
```{r}
x <- 3 * 4
```

To assign values use this format:

```{r eval=FALSE}
object_name <- value
```

**Name your variables**:

- start with a letter
- can only contain letters, numbers, _ and .. 

- Make your names descriptive
If you usemultiple words - use `snake_case` where you separate lowercase words with _.

```{r}
new_x<-x
```

You can inspect an object by typing its name:
```{r}
new_x
```

Text variables
```{r}
x <- "hello world"
x

```

**Task**

Why this code does not work

`my_variable <- 10
my_varÄ±able
`
**Functions**

R has a large collection of built-in functions that are called like this:
Libraries (=packages): collection of functions and/or datasets


```{r eval=FALSE}
function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)
```

### Inbuilt datasets

```{r eval=FALSE}
function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)
```

## How to load data files

```{r}
big_mac <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-12-22/big-mac.csv')

#big-mac <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-12-22/big-mac.csv')

```


## How to create a basic RMarkdown file

**RMarkdown**: a format for writing reproducible, dynamic reports with R

Easy way to generate **dynamic documents**:

- have all functionality of Word + results straight from your analysis + data viz

**Use**: business documents, academic papers and conference presentations, teaching materials for teaching with data

Let's create RMarkdown file:

![create](img/rmarkdown_create.png)

RMarkdown cheatsheet [here](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)

RMarkdown parts:

- Meta information

- Text/graphics

- R code (*R chunks*)

![rMarkdowncomponents](img/rmarkdownParts.png)

## Summary stats for the dataset

```{r}
data<-mtcars
head(data)

summary(data)

#install.packages("skimr")
library (skimr)

glimpse(data)

```
**Task**

Generate descriptive statistics for `big_mac` datase using `summary` and `glimpse` functions. Compare the results

## 2. Data visualization with R for academic research 

Data visualization is extremely important for research, be that data exploration, data cleaning, data analysis or putting your results in a paper. R offers great ways to develop your graphs and embed them into your papers: customise your graphs and change them easily if needed – think: no more “struggle” and “battle” with your Word or Excel!
